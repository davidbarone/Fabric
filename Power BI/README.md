# Power-BI
Examples, tutorials and reference material relating to Power BI.

The Power BI platform is actually a pretty huge subject area to cover. This repo is a central repository of all my research and includes training and reference materials, examples, and tutorials relating to the Power BI platform.

Note Microsoft launched Fabric in May 2023 as an all-in-one analytics platform for enterprises. This included Power BI as well as some other tools. For the time being, this repo is only concerned with Power BI as this alone covers a lot of material.

The following sections are included in this repository

## Datasets
Contains links and copies of publicly accessible / legally open source datasets for use in Power BI training dashboards.

## Styling
Contains example styles for use in Power BI reports. 

## DAX
Learning material, reference guides and examples of DAX queries.
